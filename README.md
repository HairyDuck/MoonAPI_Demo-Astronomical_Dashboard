A real-time astronomical dashboard demonstrating the capabilities of [Moon-API.com](https://moon-api.com). This interactive dashboard visualizes lunar and solar data, providing a comprehensive view of celestial positions, phases, and astronomical events.

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time Data Updates**: Automatically refreshes every 5 minutes
- **Interactive Charts**: 
  - Moon Position (Altitude & Azimuth)
  - Sun Position (Altitude & Azimuth)
  - Celestial Distances
- **Detailed Information**:
  - Current Moon Phase & Illumination
  - Sun Rise/Set Times
  - Zodiac Information
  - Equipment Recommendations
  - Optimal Viewing Periods
- **Data Explorer**: Click any value to see its location in the API response
- **Historical Data**: Tracks and displays 7 days of data
- **Demo Mode**: Try the dashboard without an API key

## 🚀 Getting Started
